# Mass Shooting EDA (2016-2021)

Given the rise of mass shootings in the US, I was curious to explore a data set that can lend insights into the frequency and location of these incidents. This data set was downloaded from Kaggle and I explored it to investigate whether there is a correlation between the number of incidents and time of the year, create a location plot of these incidents, and if there is a correlation among the attributes of the data set.

## Data Set Attributes:

---  ------          --------------  -----  
* 0   Incident ID     -2000 non-null   int64  
* 1   Incident Date   -2000 non-null   object 
* 2   State           -2000 non-null   object 
* 3   City Or County  -2000 non-null   object 
* 4   Address         -1997 non-null   object 
* 5   # Killed        -2000 non-null   int64  
* 6   # Injured       -2000 non-null   int64
