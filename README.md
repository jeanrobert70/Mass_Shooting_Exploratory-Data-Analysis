# Mass Shooting EDA (2016-2021)

Given the rise of mass shooting in the US, I was curious to explore a data set that can lend insights into the frequency and location of these incidents. This data set was downloaded from kaggle and was used to investigate whether is a correlation between the number of incidents and time of the year, location of these shootings, and if there is a correlation among the arributes of the data set.

## Data Set Attributes:

---  ------          --------------  -----  
* 0   Incident ID     2000 non-null   int64  
* 1   Incident Date   2000 non-null   object 
* 2   State           2000 non-null   object 
* 3   City Or County  2000 non-null   object 
* 4   Address         1997 non-null   object 
* 5   # Killed        2000 non-null   int64  
* 6   # Injured       2000 non-null   int64
